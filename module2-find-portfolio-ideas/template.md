# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

  *Being rich, especially by means of making wise investments in real estate.*

What do you know about?

  *Real estate. My wife and I own 4 units, and are in the process of buying another four.*

What decisions do you face?

  *There are many, many variables to consider when purchasing an investment property. Appreciation can be the easiest way to acquire wealth over long periods of time. What hidden data is there that can predict appreciation in real estate? A reliable answer to that question would be worth a lot of money.*

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  *As the cliche goes, the three most important factors in a home are location, location, and location. Data is easily available on where real estate is valueable now, but hidden variables may exist that could predict appreciation in a new way.*

2. Trend related to the news

  *The real estate bubble collapsing in 2008 was big news. Many people have some stake in real estate so there are frequent news blurbs about possible future fluctuations in real estate markets. *

3. Who does that?

  *Investors. Anyone wealthy enough to invest in real estate usually does, beit in their own home or in an investment property.*

4. Answering a question people care about

  *"Does this home possess qualities that tend to indicate future appreciation?" It's a question that everyone should ask before purchasing a home.*

5. Valuable to businesses

  *I'm kind of shooting for the stars here. If I can find a reliable way to predict appreciation that hasn't been thought of before, no Davies would ever have to work again, as long as I don't have any sons.*
  
6. What's the most popular?

  *As far as investment properties go, there really isn't a 'most popular.' Any investment is a good investment at the right price. There are several popular real estate blogs, podcasts and networking resources. My favorite is BiggerPockets.*

7. Cost/Money rankings

  *What is the most valuable real estate? I don't know. Probably San Francisco somewhere. Or maybe Manhattan.*

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

  *Any real estate can be over- or under-priced, and there is a huge number of variables to consider in a purchase. Some May indicate a higher probably of improved returns. Many investors just consider the purchase price and rent rates of a property, because predicting appreciation is hard.*

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

  *https://www.manausa.com/blog/big-homes-fail-to-join-the-real-estate-appreciation-party/ This page has a graphic that compares home cost/area among homes of different sizes. Data showed that the largest homes retained their value better than the smallest homes through the 2008-2011 slump.*

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

  *Volume of homes sold is an important consideration. Home values may have been more stable at the top, but predict that benefit is hedged by the increase in difficulty selling them. People with larger homes are better able to hold where those with smaller homes would be required to sell at a loss to make ends meet.*

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

  *What makes an investment recession-proof?*

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

  *The style isn't particularly unique. It could apply to any data displaying change over time for a binned population.*

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

  *States are required to keep a detailed public ledger of all real estate transactions.*

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.
What do you care about?

  *Skiing.*

What do you know about?

  *Skiing. I'm a professional ski instructor, and I worked at Deer Valley Ski Resort for 10 years.*

What decisions do you face?

  *Which resort? What gear should I buy? When should I plan my trips?*

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  *The most important choice in skiing is the destination. I'd rather spend a day at a great resort with cheap gear than a crummy resort with the best skiis.*

2. Trend related to the news

  *Winter olympics are a big deal every 4 years. There is a bustling culture of skiiers that tune in closely to the news for information on weather and possible closures.*

3. Who does that?

  *Skiiers are typically healthy, finacially stable, caucasian, young people. Though there are probably a lot of outliers on age, since skiing can be easier to fit in to a schedule post-retirement.*

4. Answering a question people care about

  *Many variables affect the outcome of a ski trip. What can a skier do to give themselves the best experience?*

5. Valuable to businesses

  *If ski resorts can isolate the hidden variables that matter to skiers, improving upon them will bring them more business.*
  
6. What's the most popular?

  *The most popular ski resort, according to Ski Magazine, is Deer Valley. That's because Deer Valley gives season pass holders a year subscription to Ski Magazine, entitling them to a vote. *

7. Cost/Money rankings

  *The most valuable ski gear company is Volkl, as they sell a better-than-average product to every market. Volkl hits the profitablity point between quatlity and affordable perfectly.*

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

  *Skiing can be expensive, but it's well within reach of most budgets. Also, I believe most variables in a ski trip can be controlled.*

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

  *It will be more difficult to get data on many of the variables associated with skiing. Weather data is easy to find. Hopefully I can find where ski resorts publish their daily ticket sales? What are the odds they post their marketing research information publicly?*

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

  *These are two vastly different fields. Finance vs leisure. There will be a ton of data available publicly for real estate, which is good and bad. Good, because I don't have to dig very hard to find the information I need; but bad because since there is so much money at stake, it will be hard to come up with a data presentation that is both original and meaningful. The opposite problem exists for the skiing question. I'm thinking I'll plan on using real estate, so I don't have to mess with low quality data so much.*
